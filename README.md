# rpg-scripts
Sometimes when i play role-playing games with my friends, i hava a very HARD time with the npcs. (For example names or other things). This is a simple script to do that. 

<h1>femaleName, maleName:</h1>
I want to try differents thing here. I have experience with JSON and Groovy, but none with Python. So I tried differents thing, it's a little messy maybe, but i want to try differents ways to use JSON and Python.
These scripts are simple, only give a random name.
