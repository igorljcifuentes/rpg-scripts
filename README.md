# rpg-scripts
Sometimes when i play role-playing games with my friends, i hava a very HARD time with the npcs. (For example names or other things). This is a repository of tools to make a master life more simple.

Scripts Actors:
Master: Me :D
Player: A random player
Chalo: These kind of player who will ask EVERYTHING... when i say EVERYTHING is EVERYTHING, even exact size of the scar in his finger...

# menu
"Master: You see a big and strange door
Player: I open that door
Master: Onlye the darkness"

Under construction...

# femaleName & maleName:
"Master: Ok, you can see a lot of people in the place... someones speaking, other drinkings... and doing stuff, you don't care much about that
Player: We can ask around
Master: That's a good idea. Ok, you as...
Chalo: I ask to the first person his name
Master: His name is... (F*@K! DON'T PANIC! DON'T PANIC... CHALO SON OF A...)
" 

I want to try differents thing here. I have experience with JSON and Groovy, but none with Python. So I tried differents thing, it's a little messy maybe, but i want to try differents ways to use JSON and Python.
These scripts are simple, only give a random name.

# maleNPC
"Master: .. Maybe a nice guy or a badass guy.
Player: He have a fun name...
Chalo: Like you... well, how is that NPC?
Master: Let me see his sheet... (OH COME ON! DON'T PANIC! Maybe a giant robot or a dragonslayer sword will be nice... OK! DON'T PANIC FOR GYGAX'S SAKE)"

The same base as the maleName. Now the script give some characteristics, to have a kind of description, but still simple and random.

#maleCharacter
