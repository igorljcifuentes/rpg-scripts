# rpg-scripts
Sometimes when i play role-playing games with my friends, i have a very HARD time with the npcs. (For example names or other things). This is a repository of tools to make a master life more simple.

Also it's a kind of challenge, starting with a base-script i will try to give more characteristics. (For now)

Scripts Actors:
Master: Me :D (Or you, or any kind of master... well... it's only an example)
Player: A random player (Somekind of player, it's the seriuos part of the introduction)
Chalo: These kind of player who will ask EVERYTHING... when i say EVERYTHING is EVERYTHING, even exact size of the scar in his finger...

# menu
"Master: You see a big and strange door
Player: I open that door
Master: Only the darkness"

Under construction...

# femaleName & maleName:
"Master: Ok, you can see a lot of people in the place... someones speaking, other drinkings... and doing stuff, you don't care much about that
Player: We can ask around
Master: That's a good idea. Ok, you as...
Chalo: I ask to the first person his name
Master: His name is... (F*@K! DON'T PANIC! DON'T PANIC... CHALO SON OF A...)
" 

I want to try differents thing here. I have experience with JSON and Groovy, but none with Python. So I tried differents thing, it's a little messy maybe, but i want to try differents ways to use JSON and Python.
These scripts are simple, only give a random name.

# maleNPC
"Master: .. Maybe a nice guy or a badass guy.
Player: He have a fun name...
Chalo: Like you... well, how is that NPC?
Master: Let me see his sheet... (OH COME ON! DON'T PANIC! Maybe a giant robot or a dragonslayer sword will be nice... OK! DON'T PANIC FOR GYGAX'S SAKE)"

The same base as the maleName. Now the script give some characteristics, to have a kind of description, but still simple and random.

#maleCharacter
"Master: The count is waiting in the other room.
Player: Is his family here?
Master: Only his older son.
Chalo: I don't remember the family name
Master:  De la FÃ¨re
Chalo: He should have a group of bodyguards.
Master: Yes, you remember the name of the chief, Larson.
Chalo: I will talk to the youngest member of the bodyguard!
Master: Oh... well... interesting (HOLY! FOR ELMINSTER! Give me a respire please... DON'T PANIC!)
"

Sometimes to have a better pace, you will need a quick character. Sometimes it's not easy have a nice or different character. 
This script will give a random generate character, a little description and some details.
